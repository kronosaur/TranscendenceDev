This package contains the source code for building the Transcendence.exe client,
which is used to run any Transcendence adventure, including "Domina & Oracus".

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

If you are downloading the repos in order to submit future pull requests, it is 
worthwhile to keep repositories synced with kronosaur:

You will need to install the February 2010 DirectX SDK release, as later versions 
do not include necessary libraries. The correct DirectX SDK can be downloaded 
here: 

https://archive.org/details/dxsdk_feb10

Note the DirectX SDK's install location on your computer.

It may be necessary to uninstall certain Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables 
when installing DirectX SDKs:

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2728613

Use Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or later. Open `File > Open > Project/Solution` 
`<Repo Root>/Transcendence/Transcendence.sln`, which is the Transcendence 
solution file. The following warnings, if shown under `Output` from Solution, 
may be safely ignored:

```
    <Repo Root>\Alchemy\zlib-1.2.7\contrib\vstudio\vc10\zlibstat.vcxproj : 
    warning  : Platform 'Itanium' referenced in the project file 'zlibstat' 
    cannot be found.

    <Repo Root>\TransCore\TransCore.vcxproj : error  : Project 
    "...\TransCore\TransCore.vcxproj" could not be found.
```

Then go to `View>Solution Explorer` and check the pane opened to the right side.
Right click `Transcendence` and select `Set as Startup Project`. `Transcendence`
should now be bolded in the Solution Explorer. 

Ensure that the correct locations of the DirectX SDK Include and Lib folders 
are specified for the Transcendence project (under the Transcendence solution) 
by right clicking `Transcendence` and selecting `Properties` to open the 
project's Properties page, and checking the following property sets:

    Configuration Properties > VC++ Directories > General > Include Directories
    Configuration Properties > VC++ Directories > General > Library Directories
    
Always point the Library Directories variable to the \Lib\x86 folder of the SDK.

In the second from the top ribbon, there is a `Debug` dropdown. Select `Debug for
Contributors` and change the dropdown next to it from `Any CPU` to `Win32`.
Build the solution. Executables will be placed in the Transcendence/Game 
directory. These can be viewed from the file system.

Now the game can optionally be launched from Visual Studio with the `Local Windows
Debugger` in the second from the top ribbon.

For security reasons the source code does not include certain files to 
communicate with the Hexarc arcology (the cloud service). The code will compile
without it, however, as long as you add CHexarcServiceStub.cpp to the build.

In Visual Studio, selecting the "Debug For Contributors" configuration will
build the game with CHexarcServiceStub.cpp.

CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

General contributions standards are documented here:

https://ministry.kronosaur.com/record.hexm?id=91287

Note: it is recommended to split up multiple unrelated (or extremely large)
changes into multiple PRs to make it easier to review. We have a limited amount
of time each week to review PRs, so oversized PRs may take multiple weeks to
review or outright rejected as too big to review.

To enable whitesmith indentation style in Visual Studio, open `Tools > Options`:

Then select `Text Editor > C/C++ > Tabs` and ensure that:

    Tab size = 4
    Indent size = 4
    Keep Tabs = True

Then select `Text Editor > C/C++ > Code Style > Formatting > Indentation` and
ensure that:

    Indent braces = True
    Indent each line relatively to = `Innermost paranthesis`
    Within parenthesis, align new lines when I type them = `Indent new lines`
    Indent case contents = True
    Indent braces following a case statement = True
    Indent braces of lambdas = True
    
Then select `Text Editor > C/C++ > Code Style > Formatting > Spacing` and ensure
that:

    `Spacing for operators > Pointer/reference Alignment > Leave unchanged` = True

If you find additional settings that should be changed to provide for an easier
editing experience, please update this readme with them.
