				Fiona reveals the circumstances around her attack. She had been
				investigating the destruction of a Sisters of Domina ship, 
				called the Hand of Solace.

				Sister Elana Ston was in command and survived the destruction,
				claiming that it was marauders who attacked them. But Fiona is
				skeptical.

				Fiona asks you to get in touch with Hugo Sandoval in the
				%systemName% system. Together you must find the wreck of the 
				Hand of Solace and unravel its mysteries.

				You have failed. Fiona asked you to team up with Hugo Sandoval
				to find the wreckage of the Hand of Solace and search for 
				clues.

				But now Sandoval is dead and you've lost any hope of finding the
				Hand of Solace.

				No further progress on this storyline is possible.

				You enter the brightly lit central garden of the New Victoria 
				University Hospital. Recovering patients sit on articulated 
				gurneys, while doctors and medtechs pass through, heads buried 
				in datapads.
							
				Nearby, Fiona rests at a bench, hooked up to a medical bot:
							
				"I'm glad to finally meet you. Thank you for saving my life in 
				%systemName%."

				Fiona blinks tears away and looks down.
							
				"You don't want to get involved, OK?"
							
				She pauses for a long time, but seeing your persistence she 
				shakes her head and sighs. A fresh scar curves under her left 
				eye and disappears behind her ear.

				"A few months ago, one of our medical ships, the Hand of Solace,
				was ambushed and wrecked by marauders. Sister Elana Ston was in 
				command at the time, and she survived along with a medtech. 
				Later, the medtech was found dead&mdash;blasted, actually.
							
				"Sister Ston thought the medtech might have been involved with 
				the marauders and then betrayed by them."

				"Yeah, I know it doesn't make sense, OK? But I couldn't find

			<String id="actionIntro5">"[L]et me guess, Stormhound, right?"</String>
			<Text id="descIntro6">

				Fiona arches an eyebrow, impressed.
							
				"Yes! He said it wasn't marauders. He told me to look for the 
				wreckage of the medical ship in the %systemName% system. Asked 
				to tell him what I found.
