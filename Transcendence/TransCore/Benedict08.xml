			<Text id="textSummary.active">

				With your help, Benedict and Fiona uncovered a conspiracy 
				between the Penitents and Sister Elana Ston. You have video
				proof of Sister Ston handing over infants to the Penitents.

				Now, with Stormhound's help, you plan on assaulting a Penitent
				monastery and rescuing the kidnapped children.

				Even now you're not sure what you saw. A winged demon? Mutant
				children? Whatever the Penitents are doing goes well beyond a
				simple power struggle. And if some of the Sisters are conspiring
				with them, the mystery only deepens.

				What was that creature, whom Stormhound called an 'arioi'? Why
				are the Penitents and Sisters working together? And what does it
				all have to do with Domina and Oracus?

				The answers, you hope, will be at the end of your journey, 
				outside the Quarantine Zone, at the eternal temple of the gods:
				the Galactic Core.

				You have completed the Benedict &amp; Domina storyline.

				The docking bay is lit by emergency lights, and a vacuum alarm 
				shrieks in the distance.
							
				Benedict and Fiona enter the bay, followed by Stormhound and a 
				squad of Commonwealth marines.
							
				Benedict waves his hand, "Stormhound, secure the docking bay!
				Make sure we can return back to the ship. We'll meet you in
				medical."

			<Text id="textRescue2">

				You wind your way through the station with Fiona and her autons 
				in the lead. Eventually you enter a ward filled with small beds. 
				Three medtechs in light-gray gowns turn as you enter, but Fiona 
				and Benedict subdue them quickly.
							
				Fiona checks one of the beds, "The children are here, but...
				oh my gods!"

			</Text>
			<Text id="textRescue3">

				You look in the nearest bed and see a child wrapped in blankets.
				Her cranium is elongated to twice the normal size, and her neck
				and shoulders are rough and almost scaly.
							
				She looks at you and cries a raspy shriek.

			</Text>
			<String id="actionRescue3">"[W]hat the hell happened to them?"</String>
			<Text id="textRescue4">

				Just then, an impossibly tall figure steps out of a dark 
				corridor. He knocks Fiona against a wall with a single swipe. 
				Benedict raises his arm cannon, but the figure is too fast. It
				leaps at him, leaving him in a crumpled heap.
							
				The figure turns to face you. His bald head is leathery and 
				elongated, and his whole body is covered in rough, chitinous 
				scales. Two large, membranous wings protrude from his back, 
				flapping slowly as he turns.

			</Text>
			<Text id="textRescue5">

				The figure looks straight at you with bright blue human eyes.
							
				"It's too late! Whether you reach the Core or not, Domina's plan
				has already failed. We humans will survive!"

			<String id="actionRescue5">"'[W]e humans'?"</String>

				"Just remember one thing, Pilgrim: the Ancient Races are doomed.
				When the time comes, be sure you're on the right side."

			<String id="actionRescue6">"[W]hat the hell are you?"</String>
			<Text id="textRescue7">

				Before he can answer, Stormhound bursts in with a squad of 
				marines. They fire at the figure, but it jumps with incredible 
				speed and flies through a shaft.
							
				Stormhound grabs your arm, "Are you alright?"

			</Text>
			<String id="actionRescue7">"[N]ot really, no."</String>
			<Text id="textRescue8">

				Stormhound waves the marine captain over. "Take these children
				back to the ship. Get Doctor Sanger on them. I want to know if 
				they're like the others."
							
				The captain leaves with a crisp, "Yes, sir."

			</Text>
			<String id="actionRescue8">"[W]hat's wrong with the children?"</String>
			<String id="textRescue9">

				"Nothing, unfortunately. They're perfectly healthy."

			<String id="actionRescue9">"[T]hey're like that creature!"</String>
			<Text id="textRescue10">

				"Yes. They're a neohuman breed the Penitents have created. They

				on."

			<String id="actionRescue10">"[W]hy?"</String>
			<Text id="textRescue11">

				Stormhound chuckles, "Does it matter? It's not going to be a 
				reason we like."
							
				Benedict regains consciousness and helps Fiona up. Fiona shakes 
				her head and bolts upright, "The children! Are they OK?"

			</Text>
			<Text id="textRescue12">

				Stormhound walks to them, "Yes, we'll take care of them. That,
				at least, we can do."

			</Text>
			<String id="actionRescue12">"[W]hat now?"</String>
			<Text id="textRescue13">

				Benedict checks his arm cannon, "We keep fighting! The 
				Penitents, the Sisters, it doesn't matter. We keep fighting 
				them!"
							
				Fiona takes his hand and looks at him, "No, we have to be smart.
				And we need allies. Sister McMurray helped us. We need to help 
				her reclaim the Sisterhood. Restore it to what it should be."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textRescue14">

				Stormhound nods, "You won't be able to do anything on your own, 
				but it so happens I could use people with your skills."
							
				Benedict looks at him, "Thank you. We don't have any place else
				to go."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textRescue15">

				Benedict turns to you, "Thank you for helping us. I know you 
				have your own quest, and it may turn out to be the most 
				important one of all."
							
				Fiona frowns, "Benedict is right. Whatever's going on, the 
				answers are out there, beyond the Quarantine Zone. I hope you
				find them."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textRescue16">

				Benedict and Fiona walk back towards the CSS Changeling, arm in 
				arm.
							
				Benedict waves back to you, "Goodbye, %name%, and good luck!"

				The station is filled with smoke and lit only by emergency

				You make your way to a large medical ward filled with a dozen
