<!-- PLAYER SOVEREIGN ==========================================================

	This type implements some player behavior. We used to implement this in
	svPlayer, but due to the fact that svPlayer is inherited by svPlayerAlly,
	it is better if we implement this in a separate type.

	GLOBAL DATA
	
	missionRewards:		Total amount earned in missions (in default currency)
	
	tutorialBought:		True if the player has bought something.
	tutorialInstalled:	True if the player has installed a device.
	tutorialLooted:		True if the player has looted something.
	tutorialRepaired:	True if the player has repaired his ship's armor
	tutorialSold:		True if the player has sold anything.
