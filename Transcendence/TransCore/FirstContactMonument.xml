            <Text id="descWelcome">

				You are docked with a massive crystalline monument commemorating the point of
				first contact between humans and alien intelligent life in the universe.

				Scores of tourists wander around the vast hall, chatting softly and pausing
				randomly at various points of interest.

			</Text>
			<Text id="descInformation">

				A holopane flickers to life as you approach:

				"Here at this point, in the year 2363, members of the Human Race
				first met with representatives of the Ancient Races of the Galaxy."

				Do you want to know more?

			</Text>
			<Text id="descInfo1">

				With almost no warning six alien ships, blue and translucent like
				flying glaciers, appeared out of the inner gate. Fear gripped the Commonwealth
				at first, but as the attitude of the alien fleet remained peaceful, wonderment
				took over.

				Scientists from New Victoria immediately attempted to communicate, but it
				took two frustrating weeks before the Iocrym (as they called themselves) were able
				to learn our language.

			</Text>
			<Text id="descInfo1b">

				Communication proceeded via computer processed code. The Iocrym told us that they
				were one of the many Ancient Races in the Galaxy and that they were curious about
				us and our development. They shared much scientific knowledge with us and then they
				continued on their journey to Sol.

			</Text>
			<Text id="descInfo2">

				The Iocrym gave us several hyperglyph rods encoded with scientific information.
				While most of the knowledge has been classified by the Council of Lords because of
				its military potential, much remains public.

				Scientists are overjoyed at the insights
				gained from this treasure trove. In particular, our knowledge of antimatter, zero-point
				energy, and transpace have been revolutionized by the Iocrym's gift.

			</Text>
			<Text id="descInfo3">

				The Iocrym promised to return, and why they have not remains a mystery.
				Some scientists believe that the Ancient Races deal in
				centuries and millennia, and thus will not return for many more years. Others believe
				that their own alien morality prevents interference in the affairs of lesser species.

				But regardless, the most important gift that the Iocrym left behind is
				the knowledge that we are not alone in the Galaxy and that someday we will
				join our alien brethren as equals.

			</Text>
			<Text id="rumor.iocrymMonumentPub.1">

				You talk to a pilgrim from Eridani:

				"Other pilgrims say that the way to the Core is blocked! The 
				Iocrym have trapped us in Human Space! Why does Domina call us? 
				Why? Is it all some sick joke?"

				You spend 10 credits on drinks.

			</Text>
			<Text id="rumor.iocrymMonumentPub.2">

				You sit next to a couple of tourists:

				"We don't need aliens interfering in our affairs, you know? How
				would they feel if we started flying around their worlds? I'm 
				glad they're gone!"

				You spend 10 credits on drinks.

			</Text>
			<Text id="rumor.iocrymMonumentPub.3">

				At the bar you talk with a young researcher who studies the 
				Iocrym:

				"You wanna hear something that's not on the guided tour? We 
				never actually saw the Iocrym. I mean, we never saw the aliens 
				themselves&mdash;we communicated with their ships. But were we 
				talking to them? Or were we talking to an AI?

				"We still don't know."

				You spend 10 credits on drinks.

			</Text>
			<Text id="rumor.iocrymMonumentPub.4">

				You talk to a pilgrim from Cairn:
				
				"Domina has a plan and I'm sure that the Iocrym are a part of 
				it."

				You spend 10 credits on drinks.

			</Text>
			<Text id="rumor.iocrymMonumentPub.5">

				You sit next to two young men from New Victoria:

				"We're idiots if we trust the Iocrym. I bet they're preparing 
				for an invasion right now! Why else would they be gone so long? 
				We have to be ready!"

				You spend 10 credits on drinks.

			</Text>
			<Text id="rumor.iocrymMonumentPub.6">

				You sit next to a young man in a fancy corporate suit:

				"When the Iocrym return they will teach us how to live in peace.
				Why are humans always trying to kill each other? The Ancient 
				Races of the Galaxy have lived in peace for millions of years!
				We should listen to them."

				You spend 10 credits on drinks.

			</Text>
			<Text id="rumor.iocrymMonumentPub.pilgrim.1">

				You talk to a scientist from New Victoria:

				"So you're a pilgrim, huh? Well don't get too excited about 
				getting to the Core. I have a couple of friends in the Heretic 
				system who say that the way is blocked.

				"Nobody knows why, but the Iocrym don't want us to leave."

				You spend 10 credits on drinks.

			</Text>
			<Text id="rumor.iocrymMonumentPub.quarantine.1">

				You talk to a scientist from New Victoria:

				"I have a couple of friends in the Heretic system who say Human 
				Space has been quarantined. Nobody knows why, but the Iocrym 
				don't want us to leave."

				You spend 10 credits on drinks.

			</Text>

			<Text id="descPub">

				You are in a large restaurant and bar filled with monument visitors.

			</Text>
			<Text id="descNoMoney">

				You hang around for a while, but you have no money to buy drinks.

			</Text>
			<Text id="descNoRumors">

				You spend 10 credits on food and drinks.
