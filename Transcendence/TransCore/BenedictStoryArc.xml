	<!-- Benedict Story Arc

	This type holds all global data and events for the Benedict and Sisters of
	Domina story arc.
	
	This is the main story arc in Stars of the Pilgrim.

	GLOBAL DATA
	
	curMission: The UNID of the most recent mission that the player accepted.
			Nil if the player has not yet accepted any mission in the story
			arc. Use benedict_missionAccepted to set this value.

	firstDockedAtSisters: The tick on which the player first docked at a Sisters
			of Domina station. Nil if never docked.
			
	introDone: If True, then we no longer need to show the Benedict Intro screen
			at the Sisters of Domina.
			
	clues: There are 3 opportunities for the player to share information with
			Benedict and/or Fiona. Each time the player does so, we increment
			this variable.
