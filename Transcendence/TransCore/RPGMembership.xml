<!-- MEMBERSHIP

	This module defines some helpers for implementing membership in an organization
	with experience points and ranks.

	REQUIREMENTS

	The membership type (usually the sovereign) must have the following elements:

	rankTable (Definition): We expect this to be a struct (or list) of ranks, indexed
		by rank, and containing an xpNeeded field.

	rpg.descPromotion: This series of language elements should define the
		text shown to the player when they are promoted to a given rank (starting
		at 2). The rank is passed in gData in the rank field.

	DATA

	rpg.rank: We store the player's current rank.

	rpg.xp: This is the player's current XP.

	EVENTS

	CheckPromotion: If present this even can provide custom promotion criteria to
		be used instead of XP.

	OnPromotion: This event will be called from the promotion screen. Allowing additional
		rewards (e.g. military ID) to be given to the player.
